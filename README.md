# About
A naive basic path/ray tracer using brute force monte carlo methods. It's more of an experiment as I read through [_Physically Based Rendering_](https://www.pbrt.org/). I also originally was inspired to play with this technique after watching Casey Muratori's [Handmade Ray](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEMXAbCVnmY6eVE-F9KZbLZbJqjS_uby3).

# "Performance"
Check out [perflog.md](perflog.md) for some stats I've collected while working on the program.
